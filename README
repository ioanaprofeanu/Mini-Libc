# MINI LIBC - SO TEMA 1
## Profeanu Ioana, 333CA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implemented some of the most important functions within LIBC.
The following resources were used:

1. For every function, I used the manual for the description and asked
CHATGPT for more details for a better understanding.
2. For the string functions, I used CHATGPT to see an implementation for
strcpy; using a similar implementation (with changes), I used a similar
code structure for the other string functions as well.
3. memmove : https://aticleworld.com/memmove-function-implementation-in-c/,
https://www.javatpoint.com/memmove-in-c, CHATGPT.
4. open : used CHATGPT to generate an example code of how to use the syscall
function. Using the result, after further modifications, I used the system call
and error handling "template" for the other functions which required system
calls (the io, memory and stat, put and time functions).
5. fstatat_statx: used CHATGPT in order to understand the statx structure and
to convert it to stat structure.
